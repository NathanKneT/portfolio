### About me

I'm Nathan, and photography has been part of my life since I was 17. What started with my first clients at that young age evolved into something far more meaningful than I could have imagined. Despite my background as a software engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Science, I found my true calling in photography. Where coding left me feeling disconnected, photography breathed life into my work and connected me with people in ways I never experienced before. Each shot, each session became a chance to create something meaningful, something whole – an opportunity I rarely found in software development.

My cinematic eye has been deeply shaped by filmmakers who dare to break conventions. Wong Kar Wai's bold compositions in 'Fallen Angels' taught me to embrace the beauty of urban chaos, especially at night. His signature neon-washed palette and unconventional angles influence my style, where I often play with blur effects and wide-angle shots to create distinctive moods. Terrence Malick's authentic approach to human beauty inspires me to capture my models in their natural state, embracing their unique features without heavy retouching – finding poetry in authenticity.

### My Journey

It all began in Nice, southern France, where I pursued technical studies leading to a Master's in Computer Science. During university, I founded the student association to connect people and parties with them, which opened my first doors to event photography, shooting concerts and parties. At 20, I embarked on a hitchhiking journey across France, an adventure that refined my artistic vision through countless encounters with diverse individuals.

My vision of life changed during a three-week road trip through Kyushu, Japan. The visual intensity of Japanese cities at night, the way light played through narrow alleys, and the beautiful contrast between tradition and modernity overwhelmed me. The raw energy of street photography there, combined with the genuine connections I made with locals, made me realize I couldn't return to a life behind a computer screen. This experience led me to make the bold decision to relocate to Japan and pursue photography full-time.

### My Passion

I find beauty in capturing moments others might miss, especially at night when the world slows down and urban spaces transform into canvas of light and shadow. Each photo session becomes a unique story, an opportunity to reveal hidden beauty in the ordinary.

My creative process always begins with crafting detailed moodboards, ensuring a clear vision that aligns with my clients' desires. I carefully select urban locations that complement both the color palette we've chosen and the story we want to tell.

### My Artistic Approach

Every shoot is a unique collaboration that pushes creative boundaries. With Jade, I captured her infectious joy in vibrant, dynamic shots that perfectly reflected her personality. Hugo's session evolved into a journey of self-discovery, where my lens helped him see himself in a new light. Eva challenged me with ambitious concepts and unconventional moodboards that pushed us both creatively. Working with Charlie and Chloe allowed me to break traditional photography rules, experimenting with unique framing and neon-soaked color palettes.

What sets my work apart is my commitment to creating genuine moments with my models, far from calculated, cold poses. Each shot aims to capture raw emotion and authenticity, influenced by my cinematic inspirations while remaining true to the present moment.

### Challenges and Values

One of my defining moments was shooting the Faculty of Medicine gala in Villefranche-sur-Mer in 2021. Managing an event with 1,000 guests alongside two other photographers taught me to thrive under pressure and reinforced my ability to capture authentic moments in challenging situations.

My practice is founded on honesty and results. True success comes from seeing genuine smiles on my models' faces – that's when I know I've achieved my goal. While I strive for perfection in my craft, I never lose sight of the emotional impact each image should convey.

### Looking Forward

My ambition is to grow not just technically, but artistically, while helping other artists develop their unique visual signatures. I'm actively seeking collaborative opportunities where creativity and mutual growth drive the process.
