### About me

I'm Nathan, a passionate photographer specializing in nocturnal urban landscapes and storytelling through images. Since picking up my first camera at 15, I've used photography to connect with people and capture the beauty, emotion, and stories hidden in everyday moments.

While I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and enjoyed the analytical problem-solving of my previous career, I found my true calling in photography, where creativity and human connection come to life.

Now based in Tokyo and Yokohama, Iâ€™m dedicated to helping clients bring their vision to reality. Whether itâ€™s capturing the vibrant energy of cityscapes or the quiet introspection of a personal portrait, I aim to deliver authentic, timeless images.

### My Journey

Growing up in Nice, southern France, my interest in technology and creativity led me to earn a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science. During university, I founded a student association where I discovered my love for event photography. Covering concerts, galas, and large gatherings gave me an appreciation for the art of storytelling through light and composition.

At 20, I hitchhiked across France, meeting diverse people whose stories deepened my understanding of human connection. Later, I embarked on a road trip across Japan, where I was struck by the contrast between the neon-lit vibrancy of Tokyo and the tranquil serenity of its temples. This journey profoundly shaped my artistic vision and continues to inspire my work.

Now, as a Tokyo-based photographer, I combine my European roots with a deep appreciation for Japanese culture to create images that resonate with global and local audiences alike.

### My Passion

Iâ€™m captivated by the interplay of light and shadow, particularly in the stillness of urban nights. Tokyo and Yokohama, with their endless contrastsâ€”neon-soaked streets, minimalist architecture, bustling crowds, and hidden alleysâ€”are the perfect backdrop for my work.

My passion lies in crafting images that evoke emotion, whether Iâ€™m collaborating with a brand to create impactful visuals or working with individuals to capture intimate, personal moments. I believe every client has a story worth telling, and Iâ€™m committed to making each project as unique as the people I work with.

### My Artistic Approach

Every project is a collaboration. I start by understanding my clients' vision, crafting moodboards, and scouting locations that bring their stories to life. My style blends bold, cinematic compositions inspired by filmmakers like Wong Kar Wai with a focus on natural emotion and authenticity, reminiscent of Terrence Malickâ€™s work.

Working closely with my clients, I aim to create a relaxed, creative environment where ideas can flourish. Together, we explore themes, experiment with styles, and push creative boundaries to produce images that stand out and feel deeply personal.

### Challenges and Values

One of my most rewarding experiences was photographing a gala for the Faculty of Medicine in Villefranche-sur-Mer. Managing a team of photographers for an event with over 1,000 guests was a logistical challenge that taught me the importance of preparation, adaptability, and collaboration. These lessons guide me in every project, big or small.

I believe the best photography is rooted in honesty. Whether itâ€™s a portrait, a commercial shoot, or a documentation of Tokyoâ€™s dynamic nightlife, my goal is always to create images that feel real and meaningful.

### Looking Forward

As I settle into Tokyo and Yokohama, my goal is to collaborate with local and international clients on projects that challenge and inspire me. Iâ€™m particularly interested in working with small businesses, creatives, and individuals who want to capture the unique essence of life in Japan, from bustling urban scenes to quiet moments of reflection.

I also aim to mentor emerging photographers, sharing the techniques and artistic insights Iâ€™ve developed over the years. Together, I believe we can create a stronger, more vibrant creative community.
