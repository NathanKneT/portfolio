### About Me

I'm Nathan RIHET (ネイサン・リヘ), a professional photographer based in Tokyo, specializing in urban photography, cinematic portraits, and storytelling. My work blends bold composition, atmospheric lighting, and authentic emotions to create timeless, visually striking images.

With over five years of experience, I have collaborated with individuals, brands, and businesses to craft compelling visual narratives. Whether it’s capturing the dynamic energy of Tokyo’s neon-lit streets, intimate portrait sessions, or high-end commercial photography, my goal is to turn every moment into an unforgettable image.

With a Master’s degree in Computer Science, I initially pursued a career in technology, but my true calling lies in photography, where creativity and human connection come to life.  

I focus on creating authentic, timeless images that reflect my clients’ vision, whether it’s through the vibrant energy of cityscapes or the quiet intimacy of a portrait.

### My Journey

Growing up in Nice, south of France, my interest in creativity and technology shaped my approach to photography. During my studies, I founded a student association and discovered my love for event photography. Covering concerts, galas, and gatherings taught me the importance of storytelling through light and composition.  

At 20, I hitchhiked across France, meeting diverse people whose stories deepened my understanding of human connection. This experience continues to inspire my work and fuels my passion for capturing authentic moments.

### My Artistic Approach

Every project is a collaboration. I work closely with clients to craft their vision, scout locations, and create a relaxed, creative environment. My style blends bold, cinematic compositions with an emphasis on natural emotion and authenticity.  

Drawing inspiration from filmmakers like Wong Kar Wai and Terrence Malick, I focus on capturing images that evoke emotion and tell unique stories.

### Challenges and Values

One of my most rewarding experiences was photographing a gala for the Faculty of Medicine in Villefranche-sur-Mer. Managing a team of photographers for an event with over 1,000 guests taught me the importance of preparation, adaptability, and teamwork. These values guide me in every project.  

I believe great photography is rooted in honesty. Whether it’s a portrait, an event, or commercial work, my goal is to deliver meaningful, impactful images.
