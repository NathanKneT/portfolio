### About Me

I'm Nathan, a passionate photographer specializing in urban landscapes and storytelling through images. Since picking up my first camera at 15, Iâ€™ve been capturing the beauty, emotion, and stories hidden in everyday moments.  

With a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, I initially pursued a career in technology, but my true calling lies in photography, where creativity and human connection come to life.  

I focus on creating authentic, timeless images that reflect my clientsâ€™ vision, whether itâ€™s through the vibrant energy of cityscapes or the quiet intimacy of a portrait.

### My Journey

Growing up in Nice, France, my interest in creativity and technology shaped my approach to photography. During my studies, I founded a student association and discovered my love for event photography. Covering concerts, galas, and gatherings taught me the importance of storytelling through light and composition.  

At 20, I hitchhiked across France, meeting diverse people whose stories deepened my understanding of human connection. This experience continues to inspire my work and fuels my passion for capturing authentic moments.

### My Artistic Approach

Every project is a collaboration. I work closely with clients to craft their vision, scout locations, and create a relaxed, creative environment. My style blends bold, cinematic compositions with an emphasis on natural emotion and authenticity.  

Drawing inspiration from filmmakers like Wong Kar Wai and Terrence Malick, I focus on capturing images that evoke emotion and tell unique stories.

### Challenges and Values

One of my most rewarding experiences was photographing a gala for the Faculty of Medicine in Villefranche-sur-Mer. Managing a team of photographers for an event with over 1,000 guests taught me the importance of preparation, adaptability, and teamwork. These values guide me in every project.  

I believe great photography is rooted in honesty. Whether itâ€™s a portrait, an event, or commercial work, my goal is to deliver meaningful, impactful images.
