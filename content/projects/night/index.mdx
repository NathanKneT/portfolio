Night is the velvet cloak that drapes the world in stillness, a realm where shadows stretch long and the air hums with whispered secrets. It is a canvas of endless black, punctuated by pale stars trembling in their distant orbits, their light a faint echo of eternity.

In this darkened hour, one feels both the embrace and the weight of solitude. The stars, proud sentinels of the abyss, gleam with a distant fire that speaks not of warmth but of eternal longing.
